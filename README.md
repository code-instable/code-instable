### Me

#### as a mathematics lover

I am passionate about mathematics. I plan to try sharing my love for mathematics to a wide audience using all the tools available for science communication :

- Articles on the web [with my future website](http://www.scienceinstable.com)
  - source code : [built with Astro](https://github.com/allemand-instable/website)
- Videos about statistics [on my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@scienceinstable)
- Open-Source free courses made using LaTeX :
  - several Github projects to released yet on :
    - functional data analysis (intro)
    - french preparatory class courses (MP)
  - using unconventional writing style 

#### as a developer
I develop essentially on Python and R for statistics and machine learning, and use LaTeX quite intensively for writing :

If you are interested in a nice and functional LaTeX workflow, you can check out my [LaTeX Template](https://github.com/allemand-instable/LaTeX-Template) which I updated to suit my needs for writing math reports for my school projects locally as easy as possible, I hope it will help you as well !

### Academic Projects

One might be interested in the different projects completed during my scholarship at ENSAI. These lead to what I am currently working on today, and I tried my best to be as pedagogical as possible, so that you too can learn about something interesting. Some are in french though...

#### Monte Carlo Integration [EN]

#### Functional Data Analysis [FR]

[![STAGE ENSAI FDA NON PARAM FGAM](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=allemand-instable&repo=ENSAI-2A-stage-FGAM)](https://github.com/allemand-instable/ENSAI-2A-stage-FGAM)

[![FDA - Présentation APLS](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=allemand-instable&repo=ENSAI-3A-FDA-Presentation-APLS)](https://github.com/allemand-instable/ENSAI-3A-FDA-Presentation-APLS)

These projects lead me to what I do today which is research in Statistics in the field of Functional Data Analysis.
